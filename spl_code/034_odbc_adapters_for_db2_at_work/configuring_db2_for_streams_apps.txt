=====================

Following are the details for using DB2 Express-C v9.7 installed on the 
virtual machine (with 64 bit RHEL and Streams) distributed for IBM internal use.

node:           streams
port:           50000
DB2 instance:   db2inst1
password:       db2expr1

If you are running this example inside the "RHEL + Streams" VM distributed for IBM internal use,
then everything is already configured for you to use the Streams ODBC operators with DB2.

If you are trying to run this example on your own server, then you have to work with your
system administrator and install and configure DB2.

Whether it is the RHEL VM (for IBM internal use) or your own Linux server, the following are the
general steps you have to follow.

1) Ensure that from your Linux userid, you can run the following commands inside a terminal window.
   If these commands give meaningful messages, then you have access to a correctly installed DB2 instance.
   
   db2 "get dbm cfg"
   db2 "list db directory" [If there is no database created in your DB2, the error you may get for this command is just fine.]

2) By logging in as the DB2 instance user, you can create a new database called "MYDB". After creating
   the database, you can log out of the DB2 instance userid and return back to your regular userid.
   In a properly configured DB2 environment, regular userids typically source the profile of
   the DB2 instance user (e-g: source ~db2inst1/sqllib/db2profile)
   (In the IBM internal use only VM, DB2 instance userid and password are as shown at the top of this file.)

3) Now, you can ran the "db2" CLP on a terminal window. Start a DB2 shell by typing db2. 
   Inside the DB2 shell, type the following commands.

   a) connect to MYDB user <USERID> using <PASSWD>
      (If you are using the IBM internal use only RHEL VM, you can substitute the <USERID> and <PASWD> with
       the DB2 instance userid and DB2 instance user's password as shown at the top of this file.

   b) Create an Order table to read the initial tuples from that table.

      create table Order (OrderId bigint, CustomerName varchar(50), CustomerId bigint, ProductName varchar(50), ProductId bigint, Price varchar(10))

   c) Verify the layout of the newly created Order table.

      describe table order

   d) Then, insert 10 rows into the order table with random data.

      insert into order values(34567, 'John Price', 453234, 'iPod Nano', 53234223, '231.56')

      insert into order values(633623, 'Joe Hansen', 64334, 'Samsung Droid', 8324233, '183.25')

      insert into order values(6576323, 'Mary Keller', 934213, 'Dell Inspiron', 4534234, '389.46')

      insert into order values(7344234, 'Peter Parker', 234126, 'iomega USB Hard Drive', 1355234, '89.47')

      insert into order values(3452454, 'Jeff Boros', 4352344, 'Lexmark Laser Printer', 3452346, '102.56')

      insert into order values(4563456, 'Mark Zeltman', 3452361, 'Tennis Equipment', 262345, '289.52')

      insert into order values(5463454, 'Carly Ferona', 453433, 'Beauty Set', 345232, '154.34')

      insert into order values(84564534, 'Wendy Valkerno', 341534, 'Party Dress', 435224, '187.34')

      insert into order values(56564567, 'Matt Troutin', 6743236, 'Apple iPad', 2343443, '574.72')

      insert into order values(64536345, 'David Kerner', 7345743, 'Tax Software', 3423462, '33.78')

   e) Ensure there are 10 rows in that table.

      select count(*) from order

   f) Create an empty table called OrderResults that will be used to store the Sink results using the ODBCAppend.

   create table OrderResults (OrderId bigint, CustomerName varchar(50), CustomerId bigint, ProductName varchar(50), ProductId bigint, Price varchar(10), ShipmentStatus bigint, ShippingDate varchar(50))


4) After writing the application that uses the ODBC adapter operators (ODBCSource, ODBCAppend, and ODBCEnrich), set the
   following environment variables on the terminal in order to compile the application correctly.
   [In the IBM internal use only RHEL VM, this step is already performed inside the .bashrc file.]

   export STREAMS_ADAPTERS_ODBC_DB2=1
   export STREAMS_ADAPTERS_ODBC_INCPATH=/opt/ibm/db2/V9.7/include/
   export STREAMS_ADAPTERS_ODBC_LIBPATH=/opt/ibm/db2/V9.7/lib64/

5) Now, you can run the SPL application (034_odbc_adaters_at_work).
   It is a simple application that puts all the three ODBC operators to use.
   Read the SPL file in this project to learn more details about running this application.


6) After running the application, ensure that all the rows in the OrderResults table are deleted. 
   Otherwise, the table will keep growing whenever the application is run. 
   You can give the following command in a DB2 CLP to delete all the rows in the OrderResults table..

   delete from OrderResults
